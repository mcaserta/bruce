# Getting Started

## Requirements

Bruce requires Java 15. That's it. That's the whole requirement.

You also need to understand basic cryptography concepts. If you need a refesher, I suggest trying [Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorythms and Source Code in C](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0471117099) by [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/). Otherwise, googling the api keywords should be okay too.

## Setup

Grab the [latest package release](https://github.com/mcaserta?tab=packages&repo_name=bruce) from github.
