# Getting Started

## Requirements

Bruce requires Java 15. That's it. That's the whole requirement.

You also need to understand basic cryptography concepts. If you need a refresher, I suggest [Cryptography Engineering](https://www.schneier.com/books/cryptography-engineering/) and [Applied Cryptography](https://www.schneier.com/books/applied-cryptography/), both by [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/). 

## Setup

Grab the [latest package release](https://github.com/mcaserta?tab=packages&repo_name=bruce) from GitHub.
